# OpenCode Context

## Preferences
- Ask before committing to git
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Run tests after making changes
- Keep code simple — no over-engineering

## Environment
- System/dotfiles are managed declaratively via Nix: home-manager (Linux and macOS, user-level), nix-darwin (macOS, system-level), NixOS (Linux, system-level)
- Config files under `$HOME` are often symlinks into `/nix/store` (or an out-of-store symlink via `mkOutOfStoreSymlink`, pointing straight at the repo), generated from a nix-config repo — edit the source in that repo, not the symlink target

## Language
- Code, identifiers, documentation, comments, and commit messages: always in English
- Chat explanations: always in Portuguese

## Comments
- No large comments or explanations in the middle of code — put that in documentation instead
- Only comment to document the code itself (non-obvious why), never to narrate what it does
- They must be simple and concise, and always short (less than 1 line)

## Commits
- Use Conventional Commits format (`feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, etc.)
- Never add a `Co-Authored-By` trailer or any other co-author attribution to commit messages

## Sourcing
- Always state the source of any information given, and verify it before asserting it

## Tooling
- Use CLI tools (`gh`, `aws`, `gcloud`, etc.) for external services instead of raw API calls, when available
- Before installing or using a tool/language version globally, check if the repo defines a dev environment (`devenv.nix`, `flake.nix`, `.devcontainer/`, `shell.nix`, `.envrc`) and use that instead (`nix develop`, `devenv shell`, etc.)
- Don't add packages to a global/user profile to satisfy a per-repo need — add them to the repo's own dev environment file
- For one-off scripts (e.g. Python with dependencies), reach for Nix before global `pip`/`npm install`/etc: `nix shell`/`nix run` for throwaway use, `devenv.nix`/`flake.nix` if it's project-scoped and reusable

## Workflow
- When something goes sideways, stop and re-plan — don't keep pushing
- After finishing a task: run typecheck, tests, and lint before calling it done
- Show evidence of completion (test output, command run) rather than just asserting a task is done
- When compacting, always preserve the full list of modified files and any test commands

## Style
- Prefer small, focused functions
- Use early returns over nested conditionals
