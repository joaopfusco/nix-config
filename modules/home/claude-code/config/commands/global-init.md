description: Scaffold a lean repo-specific .claude/ (.claude/CLAUDE.md + settings + structure)
argument-hint: "[empty | subpath to focus on]"
---

Scaffold a **lean, repo-specific** `.claude/` for this project. Focus: **$ARGUMENTS**
(if empty, the whole repo). Richer than the built-in `/init`: it also sets up
`.claude/` structure — but stays minimal and never duplicates my global config.

## 1. Analyze the repo (detect, don't assume)

- **Stack / package managers:** `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`/`requirements*.txt`,
  `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `*.csproj`/`*.sln`, etc.
- **Commands:** the canonical build / test / lint / run. Read `package.json` scripts,
  `Makefile`, `justfile`, `Taskfile`, `pyproject` (hatch/poe), `go`/`cargo`/`dotnet`
  conventions. Cross-check `.github/workflows` for the commands CI actually runs.
- **Dev environment:** `flake.nix` / `devenv.nix` / `.devcontainer` / `.envrc`. If one
  exists, commands must run **inside it** — record that.
- **Architecture:** top-level layout, entry points, key modules/packages, services
  (`compose.yml`), and the existing formatter/linter/test framework.
- **Preferred architectures:** if this is a **FastAPI** or **Django** project, read the
  matching note in `~/.claude/references/architectures/` (`fastapi.md` / `django.md`) —
  those describe how I like these structured. Describe the repo's *actual* layout in the
  CLAUDE.md and flag any deviation from that reference. For a greenfield/near-empty repo,
  offer to follow the reference (don't impose it on an established codebase).

## 2. Write a lean `.claude/CLAUDE.md`

Always put the project CLAUDE.md **inside `.claude/`** (`./.claude/CLAUDE.md`), never
the repo root — Claude Code loads both, and this keeps it beside `.claude/rules/`.
Write the file **in English** (it's a config/doc file), even though you reply to me in
Portuguese — unless the repo's existing docs are in another language, then match them.

Repo-specific facts **only**: what the project is, exact build/test/lint/run commands
(inside the dev shell when present), an architecture map (key dirs + entry points), and
any **deviations** from my global defaults. Do **not** restate the rules in
`~/.claude/rules/` — they already load everywhere. If `.claude/CLAUDE.md` already
exists, update it in place; don't clobber unrelated content. If a root `./CLAUDE.md`
exists instead, point it out and ask whether to move it into `.claude/` — don't
silently relocate or duplicate it.

## 3. Scaffold `.claude/`

- **`.claude/settings.json`** — a **conservative** `permissions.allow` list for this
  project's safe, frequent commands, scoped tightly (e.g. `Bash(npm run test:*)`,
  `Bash(go test:*)`, `Bash(cargo build:*)`), plus an empty `env` stub for repo-wide
  vars. **No hooks, no plugins, nothing personal** — those live in my global config.
- **`.gitignore`** — ensure `.claude/settings.local.json` (my personal overrides) is
  ignored. Append the entry, creating `.gitignore` if absent.
- **`.claude/commands/` and `.claude/rules/`** — create these **only if** you have a
  concrete repo-specific command or path-scoped rule to put in them right now.
  Otherwise don't make empty dirs; just list them as optional next steps.

## 4. Confirm before writing

Show a short plan first: the files you'll create/update and the exact
`permissions.allow` entries (permissions are security-relevant — I review them). Only
write after I confirm.
